# Your_Very_Own_API_BT
An A Cloud Guru Maker Lab - 
Your Very Own API - Using AWS serverless technologies.

Learn how to store and retrieve your important data using AWS serverless technologies. Combining Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch we will fetch and populate a datastore. Students will then use API Gateway and Lambda to retrieve, display, and analyze the datastore. Storing and retrieve important data is the foundation of every software solution, and there is no other information more important than a good pun. Sometimes we need a random joke to expel out to make those around you turn away and cringe. This Maker Lab will show students how to store and retrieve great jokes that can easily be used in any of your software solution.
